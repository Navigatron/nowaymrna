# Grading

- Cover topic in-depth
	- QA format, logical step-by-step going through
- explanations, examples, applications
	- Examples? I can cite papers, it's hard to find examples for this. Might loose points here.
- Acessible to High school audience
	- Voice, should be fine
- Sources in APA
	- I accept I'll be losing points here.

- Visually Interesting
	- Colors; drop shadow on text; solid design. Should be good here.
- Engaging content - joy to read (Voice, Pictures, Videos?)
	- TODO find more pictures
- Clarity / organization / logical flow
	- Setup as series of questions, very logical flow (QA format), should be fine here
